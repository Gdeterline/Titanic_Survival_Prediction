## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This project aims at gaining skills on data cleaning, data analysis, model selection, and model building/tuning.

This project is about the Titanic Survival Rates of a person, given some features. The main objective is to build a well selected model that shall predict which of the Titanic passengers survived, based on their age, gender, passenger class, number of children/siblings/parents onboard, etc.

The project uses two Kaggle datasets, _train_ and _test_. Train is meant to build the model, test and validate it. It includes both the features of a given person (inputs), and a binary describing if that person survived (output). The datasets are sourced from Kaggle, and are stored in the datasets folder.

The **main.ipynb** notebook file contains the source code, as well as some documentation, both theoretical and practical, on the steps used/useful to lead a data science project.
The data analysis plots are available in the data_analysis_plots folder.
